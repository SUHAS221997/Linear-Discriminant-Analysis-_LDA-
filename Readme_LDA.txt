Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) on Digits Dataset
This project applies Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to the "Digits" dataset from sklearn. The "Digits" dataset contains images of handwritten digits, each represented as an 8x8 pixel grid, making it an excellent dataset for testing dimensionality reduction and classification techniques like LDA. By using LDA, we aim to reduce dimensions while maximizing the separation between digit classes, ultimately improving the accuracy and interpretability of the classification.

Dataset Overview
The "Digits" dataset is a collection of 8x8 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0â€“9) and includes:

Features: 64 features (one for each pixel) representing grayscale values of each 8x8 image.
Classes: 10 classes, representing digits from 0 to 9.
Samples: 1,797 samples in total.

Project Goals
Dimensionality Reduction: Apply LDA to reduce the dataset from 64 features to a smaller set of linear discriminants, focusing on the dimensions that best separate the digit classes.
Classification: Use LDA as a classifier to distinguish between digit classes, evaluating its performance on the dataset.
Visualization: Visualize the data in the reduced LDA space to better understand how well LDA separates the classes.

Approach
Load the Dataset: Import the "Digits" dataset using sklearn.datasets.load_digits.
Apply LDA for Dimensionality Reduction: Use LDA to reduce the dataset dimensions, retaining components that maximize class separability.
Evaluate Classification Performance: Measure the accuracy and performance of LDA as a classifier on the reduced dataset.
Visualize Results: Visualize the first two linear discriminants to observe the separation between digit classes.

Use Cases
This project highlights the following applications of LDA:

Feature Reduction for Classification: Reducing feature count to improve model training and classification efficiency.
Data Visualization: Projecting high-dimensional data onto lower dimensions while maintaining class separability.
Pattern Recognition: Using LDA for identifying and classifying patterns in image data.
